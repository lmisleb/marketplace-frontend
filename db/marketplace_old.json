Setting the bar as one of the loudest speakers in its class, the Kilburn is a compact, stout-hearted hero with a well-balanced audio which boasts a clear midrange and extended highs for a sound that is both articulate and pronounced. The analogue knobs allow you to fine tune the controls to your personal preferences while the guitar-influenced leather strap enables easy and stylish travel.</p>\n\n                                                    <img class=\"mb-30\" src=\"assets/img/products/detail/content/description.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n\n                                                    <h5>What do you get</h5>\n\n                                                    <p>Sound of Marshall, unplugs the chords, and takes the show on the road.</p>\n\n                                                    <p>Weighing in under 7 pounds, the Kilburn is a lightweight piece of vintage styled engineering.

Samsung hasn’t reinvented the wheel with the design of the Galaxy S7, but it didn’t need to. The Gala S6 was an excellently styled device, and the S7 has managed to improve on that.</p>",
